## Evidence snapshot

| Class | Status | What it establishes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Accepted physical baseline | **A3.1.4** | Native Vita boot, original data access, visible M00 world/session lifecycle, player/camera ownership, and clean exit. |
| A3.5-dev87 physical return | **Failed frontend/HUD gate** | The exact executable was installed and run, but original menu text remained absent; intro movies were very slow with buzzy audio; the gameplay dialogue panel appeared without text; ammo/health glyphs were mangled; NPC target bounds moved further right; and an opaque black period still preceded pre-warm/pre-cache. |
| A3.5-dev88 published local candidate | **Superseded local-only** | 54 focused contracts and the canonical 115-contract ARM/package closure passed. No physical install, launch, screenshot, or acceptance claim exists. |
| A3.5-dev89 published local candidate | **Superseded local-only** | 19 focused frontend/loading/runtime contracts and the canonical 115-contract ARM/package closure passed. No physical install, launch, screenshot, or acceptance claim exists. |
| A3.5-dev90 published local candidate | **Superseded local-only** | 23 focused frontend/loading/runtime/input contracts and the canonical 116-contract ARM/package closure passed. No physical install, launch, screenshot, or acceptance claim exists. |
| A3.5-dev91 published local candidate | **Superseded local-only** | 40 focused frontend/loading/runtime/input/conversation contracts and the canonical 117-contract ARM/package closure passed. No physical install, launch, screenshot, or acceptance claim exists. |
| A3.5-dev92 published local candidate | **Superseded local-only** | 60 focused frontend/loading/runtime/input/conversation/gallery/texture contracts and the canonical 117-contract ARM/package closure passed. No physical install, launch, screenshot, or acceptance claim exists. |
| A3.5-dev93 current candidate | **Local-only** | 48 focused frontend/loading/runtime/texture/conversation contracts, full 219-tool unittest discovery, fast candidate closure, and canonical ARM/package closure passed. No physical install, launch, screenshot, or acceptance claim exists. |
| Screenshot/video evidence | **Dev87 recorder recovered** | No separate Dev87 title-owned screenshot was recovered, but a user-finalized MP4 yielded six reviewed M00 stills. A private `gh-pages` player branch is prepared, but GitHub rejected Pages for this account plan; the user has authorized unlisted YouTube hosting pending account connection. The current device has no VDB framebuffer-capture capability. |

Host validation, package identity, and logs are useful engineering evidence. They do not prove panel output, controls, audio quality, frame pacing, or lifecycle behavior on physical hardware.

## Dev93: what changed, and what it has not proved

Dev93 preserves Dev88 through Dev92's shared glyph-state, BINK-audio reserve,
frontend-scope, bootstrap, pre-cache, Render2D, loading-callback, Start-route,
target-box rollback, BINK reductions, and vehicle/HMVV diagnostics, then adds
the next source-only fixes and diagnostics for the latest returned physical
failures:

- It holds and repaints a native bootstrap/status frame before filesystem and
  pre-cache work, targeting the reported opaque black period before the
  diagnostic loader.
- It fixes original Render2D text atlas allocation from width-by-width to
  width-by-height, clears new glyph buffers, and scales U/V texture coordinates
  independently, targeting missing menu/dialogue labels and mangled HUD text.
- It adds bounded Vita text-atlas diagnostics for surface dimensions, alpha
  coverage, populated rows/columns, chunk count, and renderer count.
- It adds original WWUI dialog-template diagnostics for main-menu title/control
  translations and control rectangles without replacing the original UI.
- It scopes gameplay TextDisplay/HUD Render2D presentation to native 960×544
  instead of the old 640×480 gameplay window, targeting HUD placement and
  target-box coordinate evidence.

Dev93 has not physically demonstrated a short visible bootstrap, readable menu text, paced intro A/V,
readable gameplay subtitles, corrected HUD text, target-box placement,
wall/shadow behavior, gameplay performance, loading-bar progression, HMVV
stability, or Start lifecycle behavior. Its canonical VPK SHA-256 is

## Current physical blockers

The next physical gate must establish, with matching candidate identity:

1. visible and readable original intro/menu text;
2. paced intro video/audio and clean skip behavior;
3. readable original gameplay dialogue text, HUD, pickup feedback, and loading progress;
4. stable M00 gameplay, camera, interaction, and frame pacing; and
5. safe Start/pause/exit behavior without a PSP2 crash.

The developer must not claim any of these from host tests or a runtime log.

## Capture and gallery state

The current Vita command service advertises `screen.v1`, which is panel on/off—not a screenshot endpoint. The checked-in VDB client supports the separate authenticated `capture.screen.v1` protocol, but its target-local agent and gateway are not installed on this device. The on-screen red `R` is a separate MP4 recorder; it is not a screenshot service and a crash can prevent the MP4 from finalizing.

The [evidence policy](EVIDENCE.md) and [historical timeline](HISTORICAL_SCREENSHOT_TIMELINE.md) explain the resulting gallery boundary. Six Dev87 M00 stills are explicitly labelled as recorder-derived and do not pass its failed frontend gate; no Dev88, Dev89, Dev90, Dev91, Dev92, or Dev93 physical visual evidence exists.
